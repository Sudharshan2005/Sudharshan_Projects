# Tip Calculator

## Overview

The **Tip Calculator** is a simple web application that calculates the tip amount and total bill based on the user's input of the bill amount and desired tip percentage. The project showcases the use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for creating a functional and interactive web tool.

## Features

- **Bill and Tip Input**: Users can input their bill amount and desired tip percentage.
- **Tip Calculation**: On pressing the "Calculate" button, the tip amount and total bill are calculated and displayed.
- **Error Handling**: If any input field is left blank, an error message is shown, prompting the user to enter valid inputs.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Adds styling to enhance the visual layout of the app.
- **Bootstrap**: Ensures responsiveness and uniform styling across different devices.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for tip calculation and error handling.

## How It Works

1. Users input the bill amount and the desired tip percentage in the provided fields.
2. On clicking the "Calculate" button, the app calculates the tip amount by applying the percentage to the bill amount.
3. The total amount (bill + tip) is displayed along with the tip amount.
4. If either input field is left blank, the app displays an error message requesting the user to input valid data.

## Future Enhancements

- Add input validation for non-numeric values.
- Add a reset button to clear all input fields.
- Allow the user to select the number of people splitting the bill and calculate the amount per person.
