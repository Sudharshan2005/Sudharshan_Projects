# Tabs Switcher

## Overview

The **Tabs Switcher** project is a simple, dynamic web application that allows users to switch between different content sections, such as "About," "Time to Visit," and "Attractions," for a selected topic, in this case, the city of Varanasi. The app updates the displayed content when a user clicks on a corresponding tab, offering a seamless browsing experience.

## Features

- **Content Switching**: Users can toggle between different sections of information by clicking on the tabs.
- **Selected State Highlighting**: The active tab is highlighted to show which section is currently visible.
- **Responsive Layout**: The design adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, providing an excellent experience on both mobile and desktop.
- **Clean UI**: A minimalistic and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the webpage and tab components.
- **CSS**: Styles the layout, ensuring responsiveness and a clean design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the tab-switching functionality.
- **Bootstrap**: Enhances the design and layout with a mobile-first approach.

## How It Works

1. The page is divided into different tabs: "About," "Time to Visit," and "Attractions."
2. When a user clicks on a tab, JavaScript shows the relevant content while hiding the others.
3. The selected tab is visually indicated with a different background color to highlight the active section.

## Future Enhancements

- Add animations for a smooth transition between tab content.
- Implement more interactive features like image galleries or embedded videos within the tabs.
- Add more sections or tabs to display additional information.
