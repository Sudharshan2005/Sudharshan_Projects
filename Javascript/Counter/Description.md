# Counter

## Overview

The **Counter** project is a simple web application that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter. The counter value changes color based on whether it is positive, negative, or zero, making it visually interactive for users.

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement**: Users can increase or decrease the counter by clicking the respective buttons.
- **Reset**: A reset button sets the counter value back to zero.
- **Color Change**: The counter's color changes to green for positive values, red for negative values, and black for zero.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap to ensure a responsive layout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Adds visual styling for the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: Ensures responsiveness and a modern design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the counter functionality and dynamic color changes.

## How It Works

1. The application starts with a counter value of `0`.
2. Users can:
   - Click the **INCREASE** button to increment the counter by 1.
   - Click the **DECREASE** button to decrement the counter by 1.
   - Click the **RESET** button to reset the counter back to 0.
3. The counter's color dynamically changes based on the value:
   - **Green** for positive values.
   - **Red** for negative values.
   - **Black** for zero.

## Future Enhancements

- Add animation for smoother transitions when the counter value changes.
- Add the ability to set custom increment/decrement steps.
