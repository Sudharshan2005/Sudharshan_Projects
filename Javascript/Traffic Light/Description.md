# Traffic Light Simulation

## Overview

The **Traffic Light Simulation** is a basic web-based project that mimics the functionality of a traffic light system. Users can switch between the "Stop," "Ready," and "Go" lights by clicking on corresponding buttons, and the lights and buttons change colors accordingly. This project is a great example of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating an interactive UI.

## Features

- **Interactive Traffic Light Control**: Users can simulate a traffic light system by clicking on the "Stop," "Ready," and "Go" buttons.
- **Visual Feedback**: Both the lights and buttons change color dynamically based on user input, providing a realistic traffic light experience.
- **Easy to Customize**: The project is simple to modify, allowing users to add more features or change the design as desired.
- **Responsive Layout**: The design is responsive and adjusts according to the screen size, ensuring a good experience across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content and layout of the web page.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the elements, including buttons, light sections, and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Provides the functionality to change the traffic light colors and buttons dynamically based on user interaction.

## How It Works

1. The page starts with all lights off (default color is grey).
2. Users can click the "Stop," "Ready," or "Go" buttons to simulate the traffic light system.
3. Clicking a button will change both the corresponding button's background color and the traffic light to the correct color:
   - **Red** for Stop
   - **Yellow** for Ready
   - **Green** for Go
4. Other lights will turn off when one is selected.
