# Bookmark Maker

## Overview

The **Bookmark Maker** application enables users to easily save and organize their favorite websites. With a simple and user-friendly interface, users can add site names and URLs to create a personalized list of bookmarks.

## Features

- **Input Fields for Site Name and URL**: Users can input the name and URL of their favorite websites.
- **Validation**: Ensures that both the site name and URL fields are filled before submission.
- **Dynamic Bookmark List**: After submitting, the bookmarks are displayed below the form, allowing users to access their favorite sites quickly.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styles the application for an appealing look and feel.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for adding bookmarks and validating input fields.
- **Bootstrap**: Utilizes components for responsive design and better user experience.

## How It Works

1. Users enter the site name and URL into the respective input fields.
2. Upon clicking **Submit**, the application checks for validation.
3. If both fields are valid, the site is added to the bookmarks list.
4. Each bookmark is displayed with a clickable link, allowing users to visit the site directly.

## Future Enhancements

- Add the ability to delete bookmarks.
- Include an edit option for existing bookmarks.
- Implement storage so that bookmarks persist across sessions (e.g., using Local Storage).
