# Season Switcher

## Overview

The **Season Switcher** project is a simple web application that allows users to switch between different seasonal images by clicking on the respective season buttons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter). The project dynamically updates the displayed image to reflect the chosen season. This project is a great example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can work together to create interactive, visually appealing web applications.

## Features

- **Seasonal Image Change**: Users can switch between Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter images with the click of a button.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Custom Button Styling**: Each button has a distinct color and style representing the different seasons, making the interface both functional and visually engaging.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Adds custom styling for the seasonal images, buttons, and page layout.
- **Bootstrap**: Ensures the responsiveness of the web application, allowing it to look good on various devices.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the dynamic behavior, allowing users to switch between different seasonal images.

## How It Works

1. The page loads with default images for both small and medium screens.
2. Users can click on any of the four season buttons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter).
3. Clicking a button changes the `src` attribute of the small and medium images to display the corresponding seasonal image.
4. The image displayed will change based on the screen size, ensuring that the layout is adaptive for different devices.

## Future Enhancements

- Add background music or sound effects that change with each season.
- Include animations for smooth transitions between the seasonal images.
- Integrate additional content about each season (weather, facts, activities).
