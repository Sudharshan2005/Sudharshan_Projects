# Speed Typing Test

## Overview

The **Speed Typing Test** application is designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy. By providing a random quote for users to type, it tracks their performance and displays their typing speed in seconds.

## Features

- **Random Quote Generation**: Fetches a new quote for each typing session.
- **Typing Input**: Users can type the displayed quote in a text area.
- **Timer**: Tracks the time taken by the user to type the quote.
- **Results Display**: Shows whether the user typed the quote correctly and how long it took.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows users to restart the test and fetch a new quote.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling for an attractive user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for fetching quotes, handling user input, and timing the test.
- **Bootstrap**: Provides responsive design and UI components.

## How It Works

1. When the user opens the application, a random quote is fetched and displayed.
2. The user types the quote into a text area.
3. A timer starts counting the seconds from when the user begins typing.
4. After typing, the user clicks **Submit** to check if the quote was typed correctly.
5. The application displays the result, including the time taken to type the quote.
6. The user can reset the test to try again with a new quote.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a leaderboard to track and compare scores among users.
- Implement different difficulty levels with varying quote lengths.
- Include a feature to save past scores and typing accuracy for users.
