## How It Works

1. The page presents several input fields where users can define different CSS properties for a button, such as background color, font size, etc.
2. Clicking the **Apply** button updates the style of the custom button on the right, reflecting the values entered by the user.
3. Users can continue to tweak the button's appearance until they are satisfied with the result.
