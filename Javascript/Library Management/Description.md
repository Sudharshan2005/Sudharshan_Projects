## Overview

The **Library Management** application is designed to help users search for books by title and view their details. It fetches data from an external API, displaying information about popular books based on user queries.

## Features

- **Book Search**: Users can enter a book title in the search bar and retrieve relevant book information.
- **Loading Indicator**: A spinner displays while the application fetches data, providing a smooth user experience.
- **Dynamic Results Display**: Shows book titles, authors, and images in a user-friendly format.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: To style the interface and improve user experience.
- **JavaScript**: For handling user input, fetching data from the API, and dynamically displaying search results.
- **Bootstrap**: To ensure responsive design and enhance the visual appeal.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a book title in the search bar and presses the "Enter" key.
2. The application displays a loading spinner while fetching data from the book API.
3. Once the data is received, the application displays a list of popular books matching the search query, including the title, author, and cover image.
4. If no results are found, a message is displayed indicating that there are no results.

## Future Enhancements

- Add filters for genres and publication years.
- Include a feature to add books to a personal reading list.
- Implement a database to save user preferences and search history.
